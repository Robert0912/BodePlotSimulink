# BodePlotSimulink
Switched converters are widely used in countless applications. To validate the model of the converter its necessary to measure or simulate the frequency response of the system (i.e., the bode diagram), however, most circuitry design simulation tools (i.e., Orcad Pspice, Ltspice) do not implement this functionality for non-linear circuits. To overcome these limitations in simulation and avoid prototyping before to design the converter control, this paper proposes a simulation method that allows the generation of the switched module diagram based on the Middlebrook method and using Toolbox Simscape from MATLAB Simulink. This simulation method was validated in a conventional Boost converter. The bode diagram generated by the simulation was compared with the theoretical and experimental bode. The results validated the usefulness of the proposed simulation method. Finally, to promote the control design of such systems without the predominant "test-error" by junior engineers, this paper was written using a tutorial approach.
